    <h1><u>Entertainment</u></h1>
    <br>
    <p>Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.</p>

    <h1><u>Anime<u/></h1>
        <br>
        <p>Anime is a style of Japanese film and television animation, typically aimed at adults, kids and teens (so everyone). As for why people like it, there are tons of reasons;</p>
            <div class="pikaso"><img src="animepic.jpg" alt="WholesaleMovies" width="100%" height="100%"></div>
        
        <p>
        1. The art style in some is reason enough to watch it, they can be soo good.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        2. Second anime gives you such unique stories that you can’t really get anywhere else, cartoon is drawn in a certain way so you can’t explore the things anime can, same with live action.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        3. It is simple, its another form of television, everyone (most) likes tv, so they try new things and they were like “Hey, animes cool” so they added it to there ‘cool things to watch’ list!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I would give anime a shot, watch the right ones and you’ll be hooked for life.

    <h1><u>Movies<u/></h1>
        <br>
        <p>A film – also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, or photoplay – is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound and, more rarely, other sensory stimulations.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.</p>

    <h1><u>K-Drama<u/></h1>
        <br>
        <p>Drama is a mode of fictional representation through dialogue and performance. It is one of the literary genres, which is an imitation of some action. Drama is also a type of play written for theater, television, radio, and film.</p>
            <div class="pikaso"><img src="kdramapic.jpg" alt="WholesaleMovies" width="100%" height="100%"></div>
            <p>
In simple words, a drama is a composition in verse or prose presenting a story in pantomime or dialogue. It contains conflict of characters, particularly the ones who perform in front of an audience on the stage. The person who writes drama for stage directions is known as a “dramatist” or “playwright.”</p>
